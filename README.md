# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Erick Garcia**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com/edit/#!/equable-neon-snipe?path=index.html%3A36%3A94)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [X] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
https://www.w3schools.com/css//css_font_websafe.asp, https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_statements.asp, https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_headings.asp

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

A challenge when coming into the creation of this submission was that I had no knowledge in the languages of HTML, CCS, or JavaScript so the experience was unique and different compared to other application process. Following the tutorial and the resources to know a bit more about the programming languages takes a bit of the stress away from the submission and allowed me to become better at understanding the code and gave me a chance to have a bit of creative freedom. I wanted to completely understand what the code was doing so instead of just following the tutorial I would look at W3Schools for information of the basics. It was depending on what step I was on as we cycled from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where I would pause read on what is going on and why we do certain actions such as the size of the buttons on the screen with CSS and function calls in JavaScript. This experience certainly got me introduced to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and I will have to conduct more experiments and possibly another project using Glitch and GitHub to test my skills so I can get comfortable with the three languages.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I noticed that in web development so far through this submission requires knowledge of three different kind of languages, does that apply to all web development? Could it just be made with a language, and could it be made with more than three? What is the largest amount of languages have you personally been working on for one project? Since I am pursing a career in Software Engineering how does learning HTML, CSS, or JavaScript improve my ability to solve problems and in which ways? Since these sites are crudely made, what effort does it take to secure a website and what kind of team composes a website development team?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had more hours to work on this project, I would have to made a fifth button with the color orange and made each button with a chord sound effect. Adding this feature does not make the code more efficient but adds a bit more pizzazz and life into the game making it a more enjoyable experience. I would also wanted to randomize and increase the pattern sequence to make the game a bit more challenging. Due to the challenge there would be no remorse for the player since a single failed guess system that is already implemented will stay.
